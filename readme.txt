Game Of Life:
I was asked to do this app as part of a job application after i graduated college. It's not beautiful but it has all the functions they required. 

Some things i can work on:
- Beautify intersface/improve user experience.
- Add more feaures. For intance, the users can create their own initial boards/world.

Fictional College Relational Database:
This was my final project for my advanced relational databases course in college. I first created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and then i created the dabase and inserted some sample data to test.

We used ran a few queries too that I might add later.
